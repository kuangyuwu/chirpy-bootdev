# Chirpy

This repo contains the code for the "Chirpy" application for the "Learn Web Server" course on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

The following is excerpted from the [course introduction](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-web-servers).

> Learn all about the basics of building web servers from scratch in the Go programming language. We'll keep the stack lean and simple, using primarily the standard library. Once you've completed this course, you'll feel confident building your own web servers, whether you're serving static files or a full-on RESTful JSON API with authentication and authorization.
